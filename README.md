# Buttercup

Buttercup is a small little sample app that demonstrates
the usage of [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org) with a Node.js 
application. Passport provides strategies for local authentication
as well as social media login including Twitter, Facebook, Google+,
Github, and more.

Also utilized in this applcation are:
* Express
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Jade

This project is really just for demonstration purposes but it could
be used as a starter project for Express-based apps that require
authentication (what apps don't?).
